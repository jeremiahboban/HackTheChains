## Overview

In traditional donation systems, transparency and accountability can often be lacking, leading to doubts about whether donations are being used effectively. Our project addresses this issue by recording all donation transactions on the Solana blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent record of fund allocation.

## Features

- **Transparency**: Every donation and expenditure is recorded on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency for donors and stakeholders.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Donors can track their contributions in real-time, gaining insight into how their donations are making an impact.
- **Decentralization**: The use of blockchain technology eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
- **Security**: The immutability of blockchain ensures that donation records cannot be altered, providing a secure and tamper-proof system.

## Getting Started

To get started with our project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your Solana wallet.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.
5. Start making transparent donations!

## How It Works

Our project utilizes the Solana blockchain to record all donation transactions. When a donor contributes to a charity through our platform, the donation is recorded on the blockchain along with relevant details such as the amount, timestamp, and recipient. Charities can then access these records to provide transparency to their donors.
